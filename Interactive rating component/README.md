# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

This project is a fully interactive rating system designed for use in product reviews, feedback forms, or blog comments. Users can rate items using a 5-star rating system. The ratings dynamically update based on user interaction, providing immediate visual feedback.

**Features:**
      * Interactive star rating with hover and click effects.
      * Customizable rating scale (e.g., 1-5 stars, 1-10 points).
      * Real-time feedback message upon rating submission.
      * Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop users.


**Technologies Used**
        * HTML5 for the structure of the rating component.
        * CSS3 for styling, including hover effects and responsive design.
        * JavaScript (ES6+) for interactive functionality and event handling.

**Real-time Interactivity:**
         * Users can hover over stars to see them change color, providing immediate feedback.
         * Click to submit the rating, which locks the selection and displays a confirmation message.

**Customizable Rating Scale:**
          Modify the rating scale to fit different use cases, such as 1-10 points instead of the traditional 5-star format.

**Feedback Message:**
          A "Thank you for your rating!" message appears once the rating is submitted, along with an animation.
Responsive Design:

The rating component adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop platforms.
